## 🧽 Top-Down Structure of the Ultimate AWS Study Document

### 📍 Part 0: Cloud Fundamentals & AWS Overview
- What is AWS? What is cloud computing? (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
- Cloud-native mindset: scalability, automation, fault-tolerance, cost control
- High-level concept map of AWS ecosystem

---

### 📍 Part 1: Core AWS Service Groups  
(Every service will be explained using the **5W1H model**)

| Category | Services Covered |
|----------|------------------|
| 🔧 **Compute** | EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, Auto Scaling, Elastic Beanstalk |
| 📀 **Storage** | S3, EBS, EFS, Glacier, Storage Gateway |
| 🛡️ **Security & Identity** | IAM, KMS, Cognito, AWS Organizations |
| 🌐 **Networking** | VPC, Subnet, NAT Gateway, ALB/NLB, Route Table, CloudFront |
| 🧲 **Database** | RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora, Redshift, Neptune |
| 💪 **DevOps & Infrastructure as Code** | CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CloudFormation, CDK |
| 🔔 **Monitoring & Logging** | CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, X-Ray |
| 🤖 **AI/ML** | SageMaker, Rekognition, Translate, Textract |
| 🥪 **Analytics & Big Data** | Athena, Glue, Kinesis, QuickSight, EMR |
| 🌍 **App Integration** | SQS, SNS, EventBridge, Step Functions, API Gateway |

Each service will be broken down with:

- 🔍 5W1H (What, Why, When, Where, Who, How)
- ✅ Service comparisons where relevant
- 🧠 Typical architecture patterns
- 🎯 Scenario-based explanations
- 🧺 Hands-on practice suggestions
- 🔐 Security tips & production notes

### 📍 Part 2: Real-World Architecture & Project Scenarios

| System Type | AWS Services |
|-------------|--------------|
| Static Website + CDN | S3 + CloudFront + Route 53 |
| Serverless API Backend | API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB |
| 3-Tier Web App | ALB + EC2 + RDS + VPC |
| Microservices | ECS/EKS + SQS/SNS + Aurora |
| Event-Driven Architecture | EventBridge + Lambda + Step Functions |
| CI/CD Pipeline | CodeCommit + CodeBuild + CodePipeline + CloudFormation |
| Data Lake & Analytics | S3 + Glue + Athena + QuickSight |

---

### 📍 Part 3: Advanced Knowledge & Best Practices

- High Availability & Disaster Recovery strategies
- Global architecture and multi-region design
- Cost optimization (compute, storage, transfer, reserved vs on-demand)
- Security-first practices, encryption, IAM boundaries, auditability
- The AWS Well-Architected Framework (5 pillars)

---

### 📍 Part 4: Cheat Sheets & Reference Diagrams

- AWS service mind map by category
- Use-case-to-service lookup table
- IAM permissions visualized
- VPC standard subnet design diagrams
- Cost estimation tips and conversion tables

---

### 📍 Part 5: Hands-On Exercises & Labs

- Mini-labs per service/group (via Console or AWS CLI)
- Full-stack examples (e.g., S3 + Lambda + DynamoDB)
- System design challenges ("build a mobile + web backend + DB")
- Security Challenges: "Spot the vulnerabilities and fix them"
